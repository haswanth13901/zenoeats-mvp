# Security audit report — Zenoeats

| | |
|---|---|
| Date | 25 September 2026 |
| Scope | Repository at `main` 2328d15 (release `v1.0.0`), running development stack, production compose shape |
| Branch with fixes | `security-audit` (10 commits, not yet pushed) |
| Release gate status | **CONDITIONAL / PENDING VERIFICATION** — see [Release status](#release-status) |

This is an engineering assessment, not a guarantee of security. It was
performed by an AI assistant (Claude) on a local development machine. Every
code change it made needs human review before merge (see
[Human review required](#human-review-required)).

---

## Executive summary

The application's core security design is strong and was confirmed by
evidence rather than by reading alone:

- **Tenancy.** Tenant isolation is enforced in PostgreSQL row-level security,
  and seven CI gates prove it.
- **Identities.** Four identities are kept apart by a signed token-type claim,
  and every token's signing algorithm is pinned.
- **Payments.** Stripe charges are confirmed only by signed webhooks or by
  reading Stripe back, and are deduplicated at the database level.
- **Uploads.** Uploaded images are size-capped, pixel-capped and re-encoded.
- **Secrets.** No secret has ever been committed to this public repository.

**Twelve findings were raised: no Critical, four Medium, eight Low (two of
them Low–Medium). Ten are fixed in code, with 39 new regression tests.** One Medium finding (F-07,
branch protection) and one Low finding (F-12, container limits) need the
owner's decision.

The most consequential issues fixed:

- **F-01 (Medium):** a guest's 7-day order-view token (name, phone, address,
  pickup PIN) was written to API and nginx access logs every few seconds.
- **F-02 (Medium):** an open redirect on all three sign-in pages via
  `?next=/%09/evil.com`, proven in Chromium.
- **F-04 (Medium):** staff and admin sign-in were limited per IP only, so one
  account could be guessed at from many addresses without limit.

What is **not** verified is everything that exists only in production:
- the real domain, TLS and Cloudflare
- the VM's firewall and disk encryption
- the live Clerk and Stripe configuration
- Apple Pay
- a manual penetration test

---

## Scope, exclusions, limitations

**Inspected.** All 113 API endpoints, enumerated from the running app with
their auth dependencies. Also:
- the FastAPI backend, Celery tasks and both webhook handlers
- the React SPA and the `web/login` sign-in pages
- all three nginx configurations, both Dockerfiles, and both compose files
- the CI workflow and dependency manifests
- the full git history (read locally, never reproduced)
- the built browser bundle
- the running containers

**Tools.**
- Trivy 0.74.0: secrets, vulnerable dependencies and misconfiguration.
- Bandit 1.8.6, run in a throwaway container.
- `git log -p` pattern scan of all history.
- Playwright and Chromium, against the live stack.
- The project's own pytest and node test suites.

**Not done, and why.**

| Exclusion | Reason |
|---|---|
| Production, staging, the real domain | They do not exist yet |
| Live Clerk and Stripe accounts | Only test mode exists; nothing live was touched |
| Active exploitation of external systems | Out of bounds by the brief |
| Load and DoS testing | The laptop is memory-constrained (7.8 GB); it is not the deployment target |
| Manual penetration test by a human | Recommended before launch (see follow-ups) |
| GitHub repository settings | Observed; changing them needs owner approval |
| Clerk-hosted customer sign-in flows | No Clerk test credentials were available; they were reviewed as code only |

## System threat model

```
Internet ─▶ Cloudflare ─▶ nginx edge (TLS, HSTS, CF real-IP, fixed IP)
   ├─ storefront / portals (static SPA, CSP)       web container (nginx, now non-root)
   ├─ /api, /images, /health                       api (FastAPI, UID 10001)
   └─ admin.<domain> only                          platform API (host-pinned)
api ─▶ Postgres (owner / app NOBYPASSRLS + RLS / system narrow) ─▶ backups (age → R2)
    ─▶ redis-runtime (rate limits; fails open)  redis-broker ◀─ worker/beat (JSON only)
    ─▶ Stripe · Clerk · Google · Resend (fixed hosts; no user-controlled URLs)
```

| Asset | Threat | Primary control |
|---|---|---|
| Another restaurant's data | Cross-tenant read/write | Host → tenant; RLS; 7 gates |
| Customer PII and pickup PIN | Account takeover, IDOR, leakage | Ownership check; PIN encrypted; token scoped per order; F-01 |
| Money | Forged "paid", double charge, price tampering | Signed webhooks; Stripe read-back; server repricing; unique index |
| Staff and admin accounts | Brute force, CSRF, session theft | argon2; per-IP and (now) per-account limits; HttpOnly/Lax/Secure; origin pinning; revocation |
| Platform admin | Phishing, cross-subdomain abuse | `admin.` host only; F-02; audit log |
| Secrets | Leak via public repo or bundle | None committed; CI scan (F-06); startup refusals (F-10) |
| Supply chain | Malicious dependency or action | pip-audit / npm audit / Trivy; SHA-pinned actions (F-06) |

Trust boundaries:
- **Browser → edge:** TLS.
- **Edge → api:** forwarded headers are trusted only from nginx's address (PR #20).
- **api → Postgres:** role-separated.
- **Stripe and Clerk → webhooks:** signature verified over the raw body.
- **Operator → server:** SSH; out of scope.

No AI or LLM component exists in the application (no model SDK, no
prompts, no tools). The only AI involvement is in *development* (this
audit), which is why S12 matters.

### F-01 — Guest order-view token written to access logs (Medium, REMEDIATED)

- **Where.**
  - `backend/app/services/notifications.py:120` (the email link)
  - `web/src/features/storefront/storefrontApi.ts:110` (the page sent `?t=` on every poll)
  - uvicorn's access log
  - `infra/nginx/production/zenoeats.conf.template` (default `combined` format logs `$request`)
- **Impact.** The token opens one guest order (name, phone, address, pickup
  PIN) for 7 days. Anyone who can read logs or log aggregation, or who is
  handed a support bundle, can collect food or read PII.
- **Preconditions.** Read access to logs, which are routinely shipped and
  kept.
- **Evidence.** A fake token sent as `?t=FAKE-TOKEN-PROBE-123` appeared in
  the API log and the nginx log.
- **Remediation** (commit ec5a548):
  - The email link carries the token in `#t=`, which is never sent to a server.
  - The page sends it in an `X-Order-Token` header.
  - `?t=` is still accepted, so the API contract is unchanged.
  - uvicorn's access log drops query strings (`logsafe.DropQueryStrings`).
  - The production nginx logs `$uri` through its own format.
- **Tests.**
  - `test_notifications.py::test_a_guest_link_keeps_its_token_out_of_every_server_log`
  - `test_payment_reconciliation.py::test_an_order_token_works_from_a_header_and_opens_only_its_own_order`
  - `test_logsafe.py` (3 new)
  - `web/tests/ordertoken.test.mjs` (6)
- **Verified live.** The same probe after the fix: the token appears in
  neither log, and the path is still logged. In Chromium, opening
  `/orders/<id>#t=<token>` on a cookieless device shows the order, clears the
  token from the address bar, and sends every API call with the header and
  no `?t=`.

### F-02 — Open redirect on all three sign-in pages (Medium, REMEDIATED)

- **Where.**
  - `web/login/customer-shared.ts:36`
  - `web/login/admin-login.ts:21`
  - `web/login/staff-login.ts:24`
- **Impact.** A link to our own sign-in page ends on an attacker's page after
  a successful sign-in: the classic "session expired, re-enter your password"
  phish.
- **Evidence.** Chromium resolved `?next=/%09/example.com`, `/%0A/…` and
  `/%0D/…` to `http://example.com/` while the old check passed them.
- **Remediation** (91bc9ca). A shared `web/login/safe-next.ts` rejects
  control characters and backslashes, resolves the value with the browser's
  URL parser, and requires the same origin with a path that doesn't start
  with `//`. That last rule also catches `/.//evil`.
- **Tests.** `web/tests/safenext.test.mjs` covers 11 bypass spellings plus
  legitimate paths. It was re-run in Chromium against the live site.

### F-04 — Sign-in limited per address only (Medium, REMEDIATED)

- **Where.**
  - `backend/app/api/v1/restaurant.py` (`/restaurant/login`, change-password, change-email, invite, reset-password)
  - `backend/app/api/v1/admin.py` (`/admin/login`)
- **Impact.** Credential stuffing spread over many IPs (cheap behind
  Cloudflare) against one owner or admin account was unlimited. A stolen
  session could brute-force the current password through change-password.
  Failed sign-ins for unknown emails were not logged.
- **Remediation** (019e2b0):
  - A per-account failure budget of 50 per 15 minutes on staff and admin
    sign-in. It is HMAC-keyed, so Redis holds no email address.
  - Unknown emails are counted and answered identically, so the budget
    reveals nothing about which accounts exist.
  - Per-user limits on change-password and change-email (10 per 15 minutes),
    staff invitations (30 an hour) and resets (20 an hour).
  - Failed sign-ins for unknown emails are now logged, masked.
- **Tests.** `test_sign_in_throttling.py` (6):
  - the right password is refused once the budget is spent
  - successes are never counted
  - one account under attack leaves another alone
  - real and invented addresses are indistinguishable at every step
  - the key holds no address
  - admin sign-in has the same budget
- **Needs human review:** the threshold trade-off (see below).

### F-07 — `main` has no branch protection (Medium, BLOCKED: owner approval)

- **Evidence.** `GET repos/haswanth13901/zenoeats-mvp/branches/main/protection`
  returns 404 "Branch not protected", and there are no rulesets.
- **Impact.** Code can reach `main`, and therefore the published images,
  without CI passing and without review. This includes AI-generated changes,
  so the human review gate of S12 doesn't exist in practice.
- **Recommended.** Protect `main`:
  - require a pull request
  - require the status checks `secrets`, `backend`, `frontend` and `docker`
  - disallow force pushes and deletion

  With a single maintainer, "required approvals" would block self-merge;
  requiring PRs plus checks, with the owner as the reviewer of record, is the
  practical gate.
- **Not done:** it's a repository-settings change and needs your
  authorization.

### F-08 — CSV formula injection in the platform export (Low–Medium, REMEDIATED)

- **Where.** `backend/app/api/v1/admin.py` `platform_reports_csv`.
- **Impact.** A restaurant owner sets their own trading name. A name
  beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or carriage return executes as a
  formula (HYPERLINK, DDE) when a platform admin opens the export.
- **Remediation** (a439c72). Such text cells are prefixed with `'`, OWASP's
  recommended neutraliser.
- **Tests.** `test_reports_csv.py` (7). The 6 payload cases **failed before
  the fix** and pass after.

### F-05 — Web container ran as root (Low–Medium, REMEDIATED)

- **Where.** `web/Dockerfile` (Trivy DS-0002 HIGH).
- **Remediation** (f1e440e). `USER nginx`, owning only `config.js`,
  `/etc/nginx/zenoeats` and the cache, with the pid file in `/tmp`.
- **Verified.** Built and run: master and workers are UID 101, `config.js`
  and the CSP are generated at start, pages are served, and Trivy no longer
  reports DS-0002. The live stack runs it.

### F-03 — Overlong admin input caused a 500 (Low, REMEDIATED)

- **Where.** `backend/app/schemas/api.py` `CreateRestaurantIn`.
- **Evidence.** `currency: "USDOLLARS"` → 500 `StringDataRightTruncation`.
  Development showed the SQL; production hides it.
- **Remediation** (fbb81ab, f5d05b3). `currency` must match `^[A-Z]{3}$`;
  `tagline` and `admin_email` are bounded to their columns.
- **Tests.** 4 parametrised cases; all 4 failed before the fix.
- **Note.** The negative run against the unfixed code created two test
  restaurants in the dev database. They were removed by hand, and the test
  now cleans up after itself even against unfixed code.

### F-06 — CI supply-chain hygiene (Low, REMEDIATED)

- **Remediation** (c15e6ad):
  - top-level `permissions: contents: read`
  - `checkout`, `setup-python` and `setup-node` pinned to full SHAs, each
    checked to equal its release tag
  - a `secrets` job running Trivy 0.74.0, pinned, that fails on high or
    critical findings
  - `.github/dependabot.yml` for actions, pip and npm
- **Verified.** `actionlint` passes, and a dry run on the tracked files is
  clean.
- **Remaining (Low).** Base images (`python:3.12-slim`, `node:22-alpine`,
  `nginx:1.27-alpine`) are pinned by tag, not digest.

### F-09 — nginx version disclosure (Low, REMEDIATED)

`server_tokens off` in all three nginx configurations (ec5a548). Verified
live: `Server: nginx`.

### F-10 — Published CI secrets accepted in production (Low, REMEDIATED)

The CI Fernet key and two test session secrets are public by design, as are
the `*_dev_pw` database passwords. With `ENV=production` the API now refuses
them (9387b78). A drift test proves the list matches the files that publish
them.

### F-11 — Orders API not origin-pinned (Low, REMEDIATED)

- **Evidence.** A guest cookie sent with another storefront's `Origin` got 200.
- **Why no order could be forged before:**
  - the cookie is SameSite=Lax
  - CORS is off in production
  - FastAPI refuses a JSON body that isn't declared `application/json`, so a
    form can't send one (now tested)
- **Remediation** (c2c597d). The orders router is pinned with the same
  dependency the staff, platform and profile APIs use. A cross-origin guest
  request now gets 403.
- **Verified live.** A full guest checkout and payment, and a cancel and
  refund through the kitchen board, work after the change.

### F-12 — No container resource limits (Low, NEEDS OWNER DECISION)

`docker-compose.prod.yml` sets no `mem_limit` or `cpus`, so a runaway
process (for example a large image decode) can starve Postgres on a shared
VM. The right values depend on the VM size, which isn't chosen yet.
Recommendation for a 4 GB VM:

| Service | Memory |
|---|---|
| api | 1 GB |
| worker | 512 MB |
| beat | 256 MB |
| redis-runtime | 320 MB |
| web | 128 MB |
| nginx | 128 MB |

Leave Postgres unlimited.

## Human review required

1. **F-04 thresholds.** 50 failures per 15 minutes per account is a
   deliberate trade-off between brute-force resistance and an attacker's
   ability to lock an owner out. Confirm it fits your support model; staff
   who are already signed in are unaffected.
2. **F-01 compatibility.** `?t=` is still accepted by the API. Once no older
   emails are live (7 days after deploying), consider removing it.
3. **F-11.** Any future cross-origin browser client of `/orders` would now be
   refused. Native apps and servers send no `Origin` and are unaffected.
4. **F-10.** `PUBLISHED_SECRETS` is a denylist and must track CI's values;
   the drift test enforces it.
5. **Accepted designs, re-confirm consciously:**
   - The rate limiter fails **open** when `redis-runtime` is down (alerted by `/health/operations`).
   - Staff temporary passwords are emailed (decided 2026-09-21).
   - Customer Clerk tokens without `azp` are accepted (only a holder of the Clerk secret can mint those).
6. **Every commit on `security-audit` was written by an AI.** Review the diff
   line by line before merging.

## Remaining risks and prioritised follow-ups

| # | Action | Owner | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Approve and enable branch protection on `main` (F-07) | You | Before launch |
| 2 | Review and merge `security-audit`; tag `v1.0.1` | You | Before launch |
| 3 | Pick VM size; add container limits (F-12) | You + me | Before launch |
| 4 | Provider firewall: 80/443 from Cloudflare only, SSH from your IP (STEPS §4.1) | You | Before launch |
| 5 | Staging rehearsal incl. CSP report-only, webhooks, Apple Pay (STEPS §10) | You | Before launch |
| 6 | Manual penetration test of the staging environment by a human tester | External | Before or soon after launch |
| 7 | Pin base images by digest; enable Dependabot alerts in repo settings | You | Soon |
| 8 | Remove `?t=` support after the transition (see above) | Dev | Soon |
| 9 | Delete the stale untracked `backend/.env` (test-mode Stripe and Clerk secrets, never committed) | You | Soon |

## Release status

**CONDITIONAL / PENDING VERIFICATION.**

The code is ready for human release review once `security-audit` is reviewed
and merged. The release is not cleared, because:

- **F-07 is blocked on your authorization.**
- **Production-only evidence is missing:**
  - the real domain, TLS and Cloudflare
  - the VM firewall and disk encryption
  - the live Clerk and Stripe configuration
  - webhook delivery through the real edge
  - a restore drill of production backups
  - a staging rehearsal
  - a human penetration test

The steps that need your authorization are listed in
`SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` under "Sign-off".
