-- Three-role model. Rule 18 of the architecture baseline.
--
--   zenoeats_migrate  owns the schema. Alembic only. Never used at runtime.
--   zenoeats_app      request path + tenant-scoped workers. NOBYPASSRLS.
--   zenoeats_system   narrow cross-tenant discovery + platform inboxes.
--
-- None of these has BYPASSRLS. The CI privilege gate asserts that.
--
-- Passwords come from ZENOEATS_{MIGRATE,APP,SYSTEM}_PASSWORD in the
-- environment of whoever runs this file (the postgres container, on first
-- start of an empty volume). Unset, each falls back to its *_dev_pw, which is
-- what development and CI use. docker-compose.prod.yml refuses to start
-- without all three, so production never gets a dev password by omission.
-- This runs once per volume: changing a password later is an ALTER ROLE.

-- On a managed database (RDS, Cloud SQL) this file does not run and the
-- provider may not allow the grant. Create the two extensions as the
-- superuser before the first migration instead; both are IF NOT EXISTS, so
-- the migration then passes over them. See STEPS_BEFORE_PRODUCTION.md.
