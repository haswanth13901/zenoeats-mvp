"""Every restaurant endpoint says which staff roles may call it.

A role check is something each endpoint opts into, with a dependency. An
endpoint added without one would still be confined to its own restaurant by
row-level security, but any signed-in member -- a kitchen login -- could call
it. Nothing caught that. This walks the staff router and fails on:

  * an endpoint with no role check that is not one of the few sign-in
    endpoints that run before a role can exist;
  * an endpoint whose roles differ from the table below, so widening one --
    opening cancel to the floor, say -- is a deliberate edit here, next to
    the README's role tables, rather than a one-word change nobody reviews.

No database or server: it reads the dependency tree FastAPI builds.
