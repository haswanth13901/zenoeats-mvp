"""The pickup PIN locks after five wrong attempts, and the lock holds.

A wrong PIN incremented the order's failed-attempt count and then raised. The
request's session rolls back on any exception, so the count was discarded
with it: seven wrong PINs in a row left it at zero, the lock never engaged,
and a six-digit PIN could be guessed without limit.

The PIN is sent in the request body, never the URL, which access logs record;
and one staff account may enter only so many wrong PINs across all orders.
