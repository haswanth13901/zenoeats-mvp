"""The API key stays in .env, and the customer's address stays between us.

Google takes its key as a query parameter -- there is no header form -- so the
key is in the request URL whether we like it or not, and the address the
customer typed is in there beside it.

httpx puts that URL into the text of its exceptions. So the obvious way to
report a failed lookup, `log.warning("%s", exc)`, writes both into the
application log, and `raise ... from exc` carries both to whatever catches it,
including the error reporter that sends them off the machine.

These tests fail if either ever happens again. They use a key that looks
nothing like a real one and then look for it everywhere it could surface.
