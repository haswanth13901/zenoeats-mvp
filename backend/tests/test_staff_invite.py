"""A restaurant's staff invitation never touches an existing account's password.

Inviting an address used to reissue the password of any staff login that had

the invitation. A brand-new owner is exactly such a login -- so the admin of
one restaurant could invite another restaurant's new owner, receive a working
password, and sign in to that restaurant as its ADMIN.
