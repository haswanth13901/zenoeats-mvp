"""Resending a staff invitation, and saying what became of its email.

The case that prompted both: someone invited while email was not set up never
saw their temporary password. Re-inviting left the login alone, so the page
said "sign in with the password they have" and the email said "your manager
will give you a temporary password" -- and neither of them had it. The email
provider then refused the invitation too, and the page still said "we're
emailing them".
