"""Agreement to the terms survives the order it was given with.

The checkout page says, above the button, that continuing means agreeing. A
checkbox on a form answers that question only while the form is on screen;
what is asked later is whether a named person agreed, and to what wording.

These run against the real database because the point is what is on the row
afterwards, not what the endpoint returned.
