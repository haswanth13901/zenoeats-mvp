"""An order remembers what its delivery cost, and why.

Two facts survive on the order: the fee, because it is money the customer paid
and a receipt has to explain it, and the distance, because it is what chose the
fee. Neither is a pointer at the ring that applied -- a restaurant replaces its
rings as a set whenever it edits them, so the rule is gone by the next save
while "3.2 miles, $4" stays true.

The rest of this file is about the pairing that must not come apart: a fee
without a delivery. Nothing in the application would create one, which is
exactly why it is checked in three places -- the service names it, and the
database refuses it even if a future refactor stops asking.
