"""Staff can fix their own name and change the address they sign in with.

Neither was possible: a name typed wrong at invitation stayed wrong on every
ticket, and an address could only be changed by the platform.

The email half is the dangerous half. Sign-in finds a staff account by address
alone and expects exactly one row, so two accounts sharing an address make
both of them unreachable -- typing a colleague's address into your own
settings would have locked them out, and locked you out with them. That is
what the refusal here is for, and the test that matters most in this file.
