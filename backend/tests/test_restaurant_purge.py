"""Removing a restaurant for good, and refusing to.

The ordinary delete is a soft one and stays that way: a restaurant that has
traded has orders, payments and tax history hanging off it. The purge is for
the other case -- a draft nobody used, a duplicate from a typo, a throwaway
left by a test run -- and the whole question is telling those apart.
