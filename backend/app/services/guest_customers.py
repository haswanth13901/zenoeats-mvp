"""Guest customers: the users row behind an order with no account.

Deliberately the same shape as a signed-in customer, because everything
downstream -- the orders foreign key, idempotency's actor, the per-user rate
limit, the pickup PIN, the confirmation email, the Stripe receipt -- already
works in terms of a users row and should not learn a second case.

What differs is only how the row is reached: by the cookie minted alongside
it rather than by a verified Clerk session. See core/guest_auth.py for why
that makes it a capability rather than an identity.
