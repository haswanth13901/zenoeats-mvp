"""Is the machinery behind the requests still turning?

/health/ready says the API can reach its database. It says nothing about
the parts that fail quietly: a stopped worker leaves every payment webhook
unprocessed, a stopped beat leaves abandoned checkouts holding stock forever,
a Redis outage switches the rate limiter off without an error anywhere, and
a full disk stops Postgres mid-order.
Customers notice each of these long before an operator would.

This module answers with the names of what is wrong, never with counts or
ids: /health/operations is public, so an uptime monitor can reach it, and
order volume is nobody else's business.
