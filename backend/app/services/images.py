"""Menu images: what an upload has to be, where it is kept, and its URL.

Three questions, kept apart so each can change without the others.

WHAT IS ACCEPTED. A JPEG, PNG or WebP photo, decoded by Pillow and written
back out as a fresh WebP. Nothing a manager uploads is ever stored as sent:
re-encoding is what guarantees the file on disk is a picture and only a
picture, whatever its name or declared type said. An SVG, an HTML page
renamed .jpg, or a polyglot that is both an image and a script all fail to
decode as one of the three formats and are refused.

The same pass drops metadata. A phone photo carries the location it was
taken at, and a menu photo taken in the owner's kitchen is a home address
published on the storefront. EXIF orientation is applied first, so a
portrait photo does not turn up on its side once the tag that said "rotate
me" is gone. The colour profile is kept: it says nothing about anyone, and
dropping it shifts the colours of every photo from a recent phone.

WHERE IT IS KEPT. Under a key shaped like

    restaurants/<restaurant id>/<items|options>/<random>.webp

and nothing else. The key is generated here, never taken from the upload's
filename, so a name cannot walk out of the images folder or land on top of
another restaurant's file. The restaurant id at the front is what a save
checks before an item may point at a key, which is the one rule tenancy
needs on files: row-level security protects rows, not a directory.

Rows store the key and never a URL. That is what makes storage movable.

HOW A BROWSER REACHES IT. image_url() appends the key to a public base
setting, "/images" today, which the API serves from its own images folder.
Moving to object storage later means a second storage class with the same
methods and a different base; no row and no screen changes.
