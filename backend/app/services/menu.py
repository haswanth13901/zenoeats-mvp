"""One serialisation of the menu tree, read two ways.

Customers get the sellable menu: a meal period serving nothing is noise on a
storefront and is dropped.

The builder in the restaurant portal needs precisely the opposite. A meal
period that was just created serves nothing yet, and it has to be visible or
there is nowhere to click "add an item" -- which made the portal look as
though nothing it saved was being kept.

Pruning is therefore the only difference between the two views, and both are
built here so they cannot drift apart.

Sections are derived, not stored. A meal period holds a flat list of items,
each carrying its own type, and the headings a customer reads are the types
actually present, in the order the restaurant put its types in. Grouping once
here rather than in each client is what keeps the storefront and the builder
showing the same menu.

A type may sit under another one, and then its items become a block inside
its parent's section rather than a section of their own. Food first, then
Burgers and Nuggets indented under it. Most menus use none of this and send
an empty `groups` on every section, which is the shape to read this code in.

    read parent_id.

    sort_order means "among my siblings", so a child's 0 puts it first under

    instead of in SQL because it is two passes over a list of a dozen rows,

    share a sort_order and a name is not unique across deletions, so creation
    order and then id settle it. Without that the headings on a storefront
    could swap places between two reads of an unchanged menu.
