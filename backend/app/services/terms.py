"""Recording that a customer agreed to the terms.

Agreement is asked for in two places, and this is what survives both: the
checkbox on the sign-up page, and the line above the button on checkout that
says continuing means agreeing. The second is what every order passes
through, account or guest, so that is where the record is written -- one
place rather than one per way of arriving.

What is stored is the moment and the wording it was given to, because the
wording changes and an old agreement was to the old wording. A timestamp
alone would say someone agreed to something nobody can now identify.

Deliberately not a consent ledger. There is one row per customer holding
their most recent agreement, which is the question actually asked of it
("has this person agreed to the terms in force?"). A per-order history of
agreements is a different product with different retention rules, and
guessing at it now would be building the wrong thing carefully.
