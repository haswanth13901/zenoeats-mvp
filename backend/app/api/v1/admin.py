    duplicate created by a typo, a throwaway left behind by a test run -- where

    no. There is no override: a restaurant that has taken money is not
    purgeable through this API by anyone.

    Audit rows are deliberately left behind. They record what an administrator
    did, not what the restaurant was, and a purge that erased its own trace
