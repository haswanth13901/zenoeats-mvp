    """This restaurant's numbers for a range of its own days.

    It used to answer one question, "everything ever", in a way no restaurant
    asks it: no today, no this week, and every refunded order counted as full
    revenue, tax included. Now:

    Days are the restaurant's, not the server's. `from` and `to` are local
    dates, inclusive, and an order belongs to the day it was paid there -- a
    Chicago order paid at 11.30pm is that day's, though it is tomorrow in UTC.
    Both default to today.

    Deliveries are counted apart from collections, and per driver, because
    they cost a restaurant something a collection does not: someone's time in
    a car. The figures are the same sales, split, not added.

    Refunds come off. Gross is what was taken; refunds are what has since been
    given back on those same orders (from the refund webhook); net is the
    difference. Tax is net of refunds too, in proportion, since a refund
    returns the tax with the food. Top items leave out cancelled and fully
    refunded orders, which sold nothing.

    Tenant-scoped by RLS, so no query here can reach another restaurant's
    orders even without a WHERE clause.
