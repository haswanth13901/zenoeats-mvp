"""Menu structure.

    ItemType      "Food", "Drinks", "Tiffins" -- the restaurant's own words
    Item          the sellable thing, owned by the restaurant, not by a meal
      item_type   which of those it is
      <- ItemModifierGroup ->
        ModifierGroup     "Veggies", "Ice level", "Sauce add-ons"
          ModifierOption  "Lettuce" (+$0.00), "Light" / "Regular" / "Heavy"
      <- ItemIncludedOption ->  what this item comes with, at no charge

    Meal          Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner -- a meal period
      <- MealItem ->  the items served during it

    Combo         "Burger Meal", sold during one meal period
      ComboSlot         one per kind: a food, a drink, a side
        ComboSlotItem   the items that may fill that slot

An item is defined once and served in as many meal periods as it is sold in.
Black Coffee on both Breakfast and Lunch is one row with one price and one
sold-out toggle, so a price correction reaches every period at once and the
kitchen cannot mark it sold out in one place and in stock in another.

Categories used to sit between a meal and its items, carrying both a name and
a kind. They are gone. The name was doing nothing a heading could not: a
"Coffee" category holding two coffees is the same list as two coffees typed
as drinks, and it forced an item to be re-created to appear in a second meal
period. The type moved onto the item itself, where it always belonged -- it
describes the thing, not the shelf -- and the storefront groups by it.

The types themselves were four hard-coded words. A restaurant selling tiffins,
thalis and chaat had to file all of them under "Food" and read someone else's
vocabulary back on its own menu. They are rows now, per restaurant, named and
ordered by the people whose menu it is.

A type may name a parent, and that is the whole of the nesting: Food holds
Burgers and Nuggets, Drinks holds Hot Beverages. Two levels and no more, so
there is no tree to walk anywhere. The child is a heading on the storefront
and nothing else -- combos and the modifier-group filter both read the root,
which is what lets a "pick a food" slot offer burgers and nuggets together
instead of splitting into two slots that can never be filled at once.

Leaving the parent blank is the ordinary case. A restaurant with eight items
under Food and no wish to subdivide them writes no subcategories and reads
exactly the menu it read before.

What an item comes with is a property of the item, not of the option. A
burger includes lettuce and onion; a salad built from the same Veggies group
includes something else entirely, and the option itself cannot know which it
is on. So inclusion is a join from the item, and it does two things at once:
the option arrives already chosen, and it costs nothing on that item even
where the same option is charged on another.

Modifier groups are restaurant-level and reusable, attached to items through
the ItemModifierGroup join. A restaurant with twenty drinks defines "Ice
level" once. The item types a group is offered for pre-filter the library so
adding a drink surfaces Ice level rather than Veggies -- and, because it is a
list, a Size group can surface on both drinks and sides.

    can fill.

    A row rather than an enum because "Food, Drinks, Sides, Sauces" is one
    restaurant's menu, not a rule about menus. A tiffin house wants Tiffins
    and Thalis; a coffee bar wants Espresso and Filter. Reading a stranger's
    vocabulary back off your own menu is the kind of small wrongness nobody
    reports and everybody notices.

    Ordering is the restaurant's too. sort_order is what the storefront reads
    down the page, so "Drinks before Food" is a decision the menu can express
    rather than one baked into a dictionary in the service layer. Among
    children it orders them inside their parent, not across the whole menu.

    parent_id makes it two levels: Food holding Burgers and Nuggets. A child
    is a subheading and nothing more. Everything structural -- which combo
    slot an item can fill, which modifier groups the builder offers -- reads
    the root through root_type_id below, so subdividing a menu never splits
    a combo or duplicates a modifier group.

    the composite foreign key in migration 0009. A parent that could itself
