"""Background processing.

The pattern that matters here is Appendix E.8: system-role discovery, then
tenant-scoped execution.

  1. Load the event under zenoeats_system (narrow declared read surface).
  2. Resolve order_id -> restaurant_id and the configured connected account.
  3. Prove the event's stripe_account_id matches that restaurant.
  4. Open a SEPARATE zenoeats_app transaction with SET LOCAL app.current_tenant
     and do the business mutation under FORCE RLS.

Step 3 is what stops a compromised or misrouted Connect event from mutating
another restaurant's orders.
