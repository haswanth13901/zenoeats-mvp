"""Configuration that must be right before the API may serve anything.

Checked once at import of app.main. In production a problem is fatal: an API
that boots with an empty SESSION_SECRET hands out admin sessions anyone can
forge, and one without Clerk configured turns every customer away -- both
are better discovered as a failed deploy than as an incident. Outside
production the same findings are logged, so development keeps working with a
partial .env.
