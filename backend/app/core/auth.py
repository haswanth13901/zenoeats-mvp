"""Clerk session verification.

Clerk owns credentials, sessions, email verification, password reset and MFA.
It does not own authorization. We verify the JWT signature against Clerk's
JWKS, extract the subject, and then resolve every permission from our own
tables. Rule 9 stands: hiding UI controls is never sufficient, and neither is
trusting a claim the client sent us.

In particular org_id in the token is a hint. It is never the tenant key.
