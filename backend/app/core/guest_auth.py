"""Guest customers: ordering without an account.

A fourth identity, alongside the three in staff_auth's note, and the weakest
of them on purpose:

  * Clerk               signed-in customers
  * ADMIN_USERS         platform administrators   (core/platform_auth.py)
  * restaurant staff    credentials we issue      (core/staff_auth.py)
  * this module         guest customers

A guest proves nothing. There is no password to check and no address to
verify, so this token is not an authentication -- it is a capability, and the
only thing it can reach is the orders created while holding it. That is why a
guest gets a users row of its own per session rather than one looked up by
email: two people who type the same address are two guests, and neither can
read the other's pickup PIN.

The token is a bearer secret in a cookie, so it is httpOnly and never appears
in a URL, a log line or a redirect. Losing it is the expected end of a guest
session; it cannot be recovered, which is the honest cost of not having an
account and what the sign-in page says before anyone chooses it.
