"""Error tracking (Sentry), for the API and the Celery worker.

Off unless SENTRY_DSN is set, so development and tests send nothing.

What leaves the server is deliberately little. This app handles passwords,
Clerk and staff session tokens, Stripe client secrets, pickup PINs and
customers' emails, and none of that belongs in a third-party error tracker:

  * request bodies are never attached (they carry sign-in passwords, order
    notes and card-flow secrets);
  * stack-frame local variables are never attached (a variable named `body`
    or `payload` holds all of the above, under a name no denylist matches);
  * default PII (IP addresses, cookies, user identity) is not sent;
  * anything that still reaches an event -- extra data, breadcrumbs, headers
    -- is scrubbed by key against Sentry's denylist plus this app's own
    sensitive field names.
