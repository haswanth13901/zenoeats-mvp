"""Restaurant staff authentication.

Three identity systems, deliberately separate and non-overlapping:

  * Clerk               customers
  * ADMIN_USERS         platform administrators   (core/platform_auth.py)
  * this module         restaurant staff

Credentials here live in the database rather than the environment, because
staff accounts are created and revoked continuously by people who never touch
a deployment. The super admin issues the owner's login; the owner manages
their own staff from the restaurant portal.

A session identifies the *person*, never the restaurant. The tenant still
comes from the Host header and authorization still comes from restaurant_users
read under RLS, so a session for one restaurant presented on another's
subdomain simply finds no membership and is refused. Putting a restaurant id
in the token would have created a second, weaker source of truth.
