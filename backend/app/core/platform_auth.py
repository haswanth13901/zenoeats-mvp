"""Platform administrator authentication.

Clerk owns customer identity. Platform administrators are a different
population entirely -- a handful of trusted operators -- and authenticate
against credentials declared in the environment instead.

Two properties this file is responsible for:

  * The password is never stored, anywhere. ADMIN_USERS carries an argon2
    hash. .env travels: it is copied between machines, read by three
    processes and pasted into support threads. A leaked hash is inert; a
    leaked password is immediate control of every restaurant's revenue data.

  * Admins are named, not shared. platform_audit_logs.actor_user_id records
    who suspended a restaurant or exported platform revenue. One shared
    login would make that column meaningless, so each operator gets their
    own entry and their own users row.
