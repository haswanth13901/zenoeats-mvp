"""Fixed-window rate limiting on the redis-runtime instance.

Section 23: this is the cache/limiter instance, deliberately separate from
the Celery broker. It runs allkeys-lru and holds nothing durable, so cache
pressure here can never evict a queued payment webhook.

Design notes:

  * Fixed window, not a token bucket. A window boundary lets through at most
    2x the limit in the worst case, which is fine for abuse control and costs
    one round trip instead of a Lua script.

  * FAIL OPEN. If Redis is unreachable the limiter logs and allows the
    request. A limiter outage must not stop a restaurant taking orders --
    losing revenue to protect against hypothetical abuse is the wrong trade
    for this business. The log line is the signal to go fix Redis.

  * Keys carry the window start, so they expire on their own and no sweeper
    is needed.
