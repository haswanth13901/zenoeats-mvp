#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Nightly backup of a production Zenoeats host: the database and the menu
# images, taken together, encrypted, and copied off the machine.
#
#   scripts/backup.sh            run from anywhere; reads the settings below
#
# Run it from a systemd timer or cron on the VM (see STEPS_BEFORE_PRODUCTION.md,
# "Backups and recovery"). It exits non-zero on any failure, and reports both
# outcomes to BACKUP_HEALTHCHECK_URL, so a backup that silently stops running
# is noticed by the absence of a ping rather than by the day it is needed.
#
# Settings, from the environment or from BACKUP_ENV_FILE
# (default /etc/zenoeats/backup.env, readable by root only):
#
#   BACKUP_AGE_RECIPIENT     required. The age public key (age1...) backups
#                            are encrypted to. The matching private key does
#                            NOT live on this server: a stolen server then
#                            cannot read its own backups. Keep it with the
#                            FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY escrow, but not in the same
#                            place as the backups themselves.
#   BACKUP_RCLONE_REMOTE     required. Where copies go, as an rclone target,
#                            e.g. r2:zenoeats-backups/nightly. Configure the
#                            remote with `rclone config` first. Give this
#                            server's credentials write access only, and let
#                            the bucket's lifecycle rules expire old copies:
#                            this script never deletes anything remote, so a
#                            compromised server cannot erase the history.
#   BACKUP_HEALTHCHECK_URL   optional. Pinged on success; "<url>/fail" on
#                            failure (healthchecks.io convention).
#   BACKUP_DIR               local staging (default /var/backups/zenoeats).
#   BACKUP_KEEP_LOCAL_DAYS   local copies kept (default 3).
#   IMAGES_HOST_DIR          the images folder on the host (default
#                            <repo>/images, the api container's bind mount).
#   COMPOSE_FILE             default docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.prod.yml
#
# What is deliberately NOT in a backup: the .env file. It holds
# FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY, and a backup stored with the key that unlocks its
# pickup PINs protects nothing. Escrow .env separately.
#
# Needs: docker (with compose), age, rclone, GNU coreutils, tar, curl.
