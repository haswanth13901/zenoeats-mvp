 * Multi-page build, not a single SPA bundle.
 *
 * The login pages are deliberately outside React (see login/*.ts), so they get
 * their own HTML entries rather than being routes inside the app. Signing in
 * ends with a full navigation into index.html, by which point the httpOnly
 * session cookie is already set and the SPA is authenticated on first render.
 * That keeps React entirely out of the credential path instead of wrapping a
 * non-React form in a React shell.
 */
/**
 * The credential pages are published at /admin/login, /manage/login,
 * /manage/change-password and /account/* -- the URLs Guards.tsx, the sign-out
 * buttons and Google's return trip navigate to -- but their files are
 * login/*.html. nginx maps one to the other
 * in production (web/nginx.conf); the dev server has no such rule and would
 * hand these paths to the SPA fallback, which renders "Page not found".
