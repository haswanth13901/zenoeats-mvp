/**
 * The name of the restaurant this address belongs to, remembered in the
 * browser so a page can show it before it has asked the API.
 *
 * The customer sign-in pages are plain HTML served by nginx, which knows
 * nothing about restaurants. They used to render the platform's "Zenoeats"
 * wordmark and swap in the restaurant's name once /portal answered, so every
 * customer saw the wrong name first -- for a second on a laptop, longer on a
 * phone on restaurant wifi. Almost everyone reaches those pages from the
 * storefront, which has already loaded the name, so it is kept here on the
 * way past and read back on arrival.
 *
 * A convenience, not a source of truth: the pages still ask /portal and
 * repaint with its answer, so a renamed restaurant is corrected in a moment.
 * localStorage is per origin, and every restaurant is its own subdomain, so
 * one restaurant's name is never shown on another's pages. Every access is
 * guarded -- a private window or blocked storage just means no head start.
