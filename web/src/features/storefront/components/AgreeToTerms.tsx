/**
 * The consent step for an account that never passed one.
 *
 * The sign-up form asks before it will submit, and so does the step Clerk
 * sends people to when it cannot finish a social sign-up by itself. Neither
 * covers the case this exists for: Clerk completes a social sign-up on its
 * own whenever the provider handed over everything it asked for, and tells us
 * nothing about it. Signing in with Google for the first time therefore
 * created an account that had agreed to nothing.
 *
 * Shown in place by the guard rather than as a route of its own, so there is
 * no URL to arrive at out of order and nothing to loop between. Browsing the
 * menu is unaffected -- only the pages that lead to placing an order are
 * behind it, which is where agreement starts to matter.
 *
 * Guests never see this. They are shown the same sentence above the checkout
 * button and their agreement is recorded with the order; putting a second
 * gate in front of the one path deliberately kept short would be friction for
 * nothing.
