 * The platform portal's header, which is the same on every admin page.
 *
 * Pages used to pass their own title and action to Shell, so the orders page
 * carried a "Back" link where every other page carried "Sign out" -- an
 * operator two pages deep had no way out of the portal. The chrome is fixed
 * here instead: the wordmark and the nav both lead to /admin, and signing out
 * is always in the same place.
 *
 * One tab, so it stays in the header at every width: a phone gets the link
 * itself, never an empty hamburger.
 *
 * Only the login pages are exempt, and they are outside React entirely --
 * separate HTML entry points served by nginx, so they never mount this.
