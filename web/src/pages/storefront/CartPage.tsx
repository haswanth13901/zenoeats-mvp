/**
 * The order as it stands, before anybody is asked for an address or a card.
 *
 * Checkout used to be the first place a customer could read their own order
 * back, so changing their mind meant entering the page that asks for a
 * delivery address and a payment method. The two decisions are separated
 * here: what is being bought, then how it is paid for.
 *
 * Every figure on this page is the browser's own arithmetic and says so. The
 * server prices the order at checkout, and its answer is what is charged --
 * which is why this page shows a subtotal and never a total.
